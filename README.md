# Book Finder

Search for books and search for words in that book.

Book Finder uses the following APIs provided by openlibrary.org:
* [Open Library Search API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/search)
* [Search inside individual book API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/search_inside)

I took a "Build it to throw away"-first approach with this project. [You can read about version 1 in this markdown file](./docs//version-1.md).
